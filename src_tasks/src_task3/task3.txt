The robot should be oriented towards the door.
The valve centre should be noted from rviz and passes on to the node.
The 5 th argument is about closing the gripper (1 -> closes the gripper while rotating the valve)

Note: We need to add a case when we want to rotate the valve more/less than 3 times. Presently it works well.
